/*
*PPM.C
*A 16 Bit PWM module  is used to gennerate the PPM train
*The PWM actually gennerates an inverted CPPM __|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|___|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|_|___|_
*this has the advantage that the pulse width can stay constant, only the periode has to be changed
*on everey compare match interrupt the periode value for the next chanel is loaded
*the last chanal value has an extra large value and is used to gennerate the sync gap
*the fist ppm train after power up is wrong so dynamic reconfiguration is used to disconect the PWM from the output PIN
*this mecanism is also used the start / stop the PPM output loading a 1 to ppm_Run will output one pulse train
*between the last pulse and the sync pulse an IO interrupt on rising edge is enabled , in the interrupt rotine 
*of this ppm_Run is cleared and the PWM is disdonected from the PIN, the PWM will stay in state PPM_PULSE_COUNT+1
* and wait that the main program will set ppm_Run again, that will start the next cycle
